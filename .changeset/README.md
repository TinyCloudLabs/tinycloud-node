# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

## Adding a changeset

When making changes that affect the version, add a changeset with:

```bash
bun changeset
```

Or create a markdown file in this directory manually with the format:

```markdown
---
"tinycloud-node": patch
---

Description of the change
```

## Version types
