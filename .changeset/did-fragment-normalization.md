Fix DID fragment normalization for consistent identity matching

- Add `strip_fragment()` helper in `util.rs` to normalize DID URLs to base DIDs
- Apply normalization to all DID fields: delegator, delegate, invoker, revoker
- Add actor insertion before invocation save to prevent foreign key constraint errors
- Fixes sharing link flow where DID URL fragments (`did:key:z6Mk...#z6Mk...`) caused mismatches with base DIDs (`did:key:z6Mk...`) in the actor table
