Fix SQL database actor recovery: dead actors are now automatically removed from the registry and respawned on next request.

Previously, when a SQL actor died (idle timeout, panic), its dead handle stayed in the DashMap forever, causing all subsequent requests to that database to fail permanently with "Database actor not available". The actor now self-cleans from the registry on shutdown (matching the DuckDB actor pattern), and the service retries with a fresh actor when a dead handle is detected.
